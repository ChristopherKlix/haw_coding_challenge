# Exercise 00 - Hello REE

This first exercise is a warm-up exercise to get you started with the Coding Challenge 2022.

All you need to do is to print the string `Hello REE!` to the console as well as a delimiter before and after the message.

The delimiter is a string that consists of `n` characters that may be chosen arbitrarily but often used are `-` or `=`.

The default/maximum terminal width in the early days of UNIX was **80 characters**.

The template code includes a `#define` that defines the terminal width to be **80 characters**. Use that!

The output should look like this:

```
================================================================================
Hello REE!
================================================================================
```

And done!

### Happy coding!
